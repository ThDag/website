      <p>
        floats are basically like images in newspapers, the text and other
        elements wrap around them. they are like ghosts and only the elements
        you tell can shape around it for others it doesn't exist, only visually
        to us. it should only be used for wrapping text around images, not for
        layouts.

      <img
        class="blackAvatar floatRight"
        src="images/black_avatar.jpg"

        title="a black avatar looking dude" />

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as you can see. We have a nice young
        gentelman with a blue arrow on its head. unfortunately this indivudual
        has passed away in october of 2029. Legend says that he used to call
        himself "
        <span class="blueText">Avatar</span> " and made foolish claims such as
        he can control the air. but since he was living in a poor segregated
        neighbourhood in USA, he was a victim to domestic abuse by his own
        father. The death of this young fella was unexpected and the reason of
        death is still yet to be uncovered. speculations say that he may be a
        victim of a murder. but any suspect is yet to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His memorial is planned to be build in the
        center of Tehran, Iran after him becoming a symbol in the uprising of
        Turquoise enjoyers in northern kyrgyzstan. the reasons are well known
        but i won't explain here.
      </p>

      <div class="clearBoth"></div>
      <!-- the clearboth is seperate because if you make the paragraph clearboth; the margins aren't respected. (it doesn't matter in this case because the margin comes from the float image but still for consistence)-->
      <p>
        now this paragraph is not wraping around mr lebron or the other dude
        here because it has clear property as <i>both</i>. So it says; Hey man
        you clear you don't have to be wrapped what so ever, have a nice day.
        (if it isn't close enough to the image to be wrapped, you can try it by
        zooming out the page and it still wouldn't wrap.)

        <p>
          Columns are another newspaper looking ahh element meant to put text in
          different columns next to each other. i bet no one really uses it for
          modern design. but its cool because its oldschool.
