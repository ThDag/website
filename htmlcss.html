      <p>Floats</p>
    </h2>
    <img class="lebron floatLeft" src="images/sunshine_lebron.gif" alt="lebron james" title="lebron james" />
    <p>
      floats are basically like images in newspapers, the text and other
      elements wrap around them. they are like ghosts and only the elements
      you tell can shape around it for others it doesn't exist, only visually
      to us. it should only be used for wrapping text around images, not for
      layouts.
    </p>

    <img class="blackAvatar floatRight" src="images/black_avatar.jpg" alt="a black avatar looking dude"
      title="a black avatar looking dude" />

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as you can see. We have a nice young
      gentelman with a blue arrow on its head. unfortunately this indivudual
      has passed away in october of 2029. Legend says that he used to call
      himself "
      <span class="blueText">Avatar</span> " and made foolish claims such as
      he can control the air. but since he was living in a poor segregated
      neighbourhood in USA, he was a victim to domestic abuse by his own
      father. The death of this young fella was unexpected and the reason of
      death is still yet to be uncovered. speculations say that he may be a
      victim of a murder. but any suspect is yet to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His memorial is planned to be build in the
      center of Tehran, Iran after him becoming a symbol in the uprising of
      Turquoise enjoyers in northern kyrgyzstan. the reasons are well known
      but i won't explain here.
    </p>

    <div class="clearBoth"></div>
    <!-- the clearboth is seperate because if you make the paragraph clearboth; the margins aren't respected. (it doesn't matter in this case because the margin comes from the float image but still for consistence)-->
    <p>
      now this paragraph is not wraping around mr lebron or the other dude
      here because it has clear property as <i>both</i>. So it says; Hey man
      you clear you don't have to be wrapped what so ever, have a nice day.
      (if it isn't close enough to the image to be wrapped, you can try it by
      zooming out the page and it still wouldn't wrap.)

  <section class="columns">
    <h2>Columns</h2>
    <div class="columnsMain">
      <p>
        Columns are another newspaper looking ahh element meant to put text in
        different columns next to each other. i bet no one really uses it for
        modern design. but its cool because its oldschool. (note: if you are
        on mobile, it might be that screen is to narrow for multiple columns
        so try rotating the screen.)
      </p>
      <img class="columnImage" src="images/eagle_or_smth.jpg" alt="USA" />
      <p>
        when it comes to the eagle that you are seeing right now, he has a
        really touching story behind him. let me tell you all about it. But
        before; <em>columns.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Columns are when a single container of different things seperate into
        different columns. and you can modify how many how how small the
        column can be before it wraps and isn't a column anymore. etc this is
        boring.
      </p>
      <p>OK, the eagle or whatever he is.</p>
      <p>
        This eagle is named "<span class="cursive">eagle of suspicion and distrust</span>" He is part eagle part human.
        He used to be a regular American
        citizen in Texas. a very country loving individual. Until he wasn't.
        because he was a eagle now. He also goes by many names such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          FBI after reading the most detailed, comprehensive, realistic essay
          about how to over throw the goverment followed by "in minecraft"
        </li>
        <li>that one eagle that i can't get out of my dreams</li>
        <li>creepy ahh looking bird</li>
        <li>"why you looking at me like that" eagle</li>
        <li>
          Freedom eagle of america when you actually want to be free from
          corruption and interference of 3rd world country politics
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        this man before turning into a eagle was racist american loving
        citizen. he believed that white men was the evolution of black people
        therefore superior. but then <span class="redText">Boom</span>, He got
        disevolved. And now he belives 🦅🦅🦅eagles🦅🦅🦅 are the superior
        species. -- the fact that he now things eagles are better since he is
        a eagle shows the hypocrisy that these people have --
      </p>

      <p class="borderPurple">
        This picture which immortalised him was taken when he was interviewed
        by the turquoise enjoyers in 1976. The moment picture was taken was
        right after the following question was asked <br />
        <q class="roman">
          What is your comment about the size of eagle brains being like a
          tiny peanut
        </q>
        You can imagine what emotions were behind this stare considiring he is
        a racist individual.

  <section class="position" id="position">
    <p>This section is for position property in css. it is very important and useful property that basically tells
      something where it should be and it is very powerful. There are five different position values;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Static</b>: default</li>
      <li><b>Relative</b>: It is the relative postions to its first parent. and also stays in normal flow of the page,
        it's
        speciality comes with the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code></li>
      <li><b>Absolute</b>: It acts exactly like relative except for two differences; 1. it isn't contained in the normal
        flow (kinda like a ghost) 2. it is relative to the first parent with <em>any special position value</em>. <br>
        You can see it kinda like a unloved child that exists but is never aknowledged in the place. just a visual
        burden. (Lets see if you can find the absolute image on this page. Hint: its a african-american cat. yeah that's
        right.)</li>
      <li><b>Fixed</b>: Now this badboy is those annoying cookie pop-ups that don't dissapear no matter how much you
        scroll. leeches on to the screen basically. but can be useful too (unlike those cookie pop-ups) such as navbar
        or other stuff, super useful. Examplified with the cat on the right that is judging every atom in your body.
        <b>(DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT)</b>
      </li>
      <li><b>Sticky</b>: This is the most interesting one among all positions. this one stays where you want it to
        <em>as long as it is in the bounds of its parent.</em> Here we have the Title for this section as sticky and you
        can see it stick to the bottom of the screen until it reache the end.<br> Think of it like those perfume sellers
        following you
        up to the point you leave the perfume aisle. (idk i never been to a perfume aisle.)
      </li>
      <img class="kevinCat" src="images/cat_kevin.webp" alt="kevin cat" title="hopefully i hide it good in the future.">
    </ul>
    <p class="highlight">The `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties work on all these except for default and is
      essential for their purpose. without these properties they beg to differ from default. </p>
