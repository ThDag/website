      <p>
        floats are basically like images in newspapers, the text and other
        elements wrap around them. they are like ghosts and only the elements
        you tell can shape around it for others it doesn't exist, only visually
        to us. it should only be used for wrapping text around images, not for
        layouts.

      <div class="clearBoth"></div>
      <!-- the clearboth is seperate because if you make the paragraph clearboth; the margins aren't respected. (it doesn't matter in this case because the margin comes from the float image but still for consistence)-->
      <p>
        now this paragraph is not wraping around mr lebron or the other dude
        here because it has clear property as <i>both</i>. So it says; Hey man
        you clear you don't have to be wrapped what so ever, have a nice day.
