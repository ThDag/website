                purely on strategy with no aspect of luck. It is played by two
                players, making moves in turns. both side has 16 pieces on a 8x8
                board. The side with white pieces move first and can move any
                piece among 6 unique pieces on the board. both sides attack
                other sides piece and most importantly their king. first person

                Chess is a complex game yet its easy to grasp once learned the
                fundamental rules. The side with white pieces start first and
                can do any <a href="#illegalMoves">legal moves</a>. then one by
                one each side does moves.

                </summary>
                <p>
                  this rule is by far the most significant rule of the game.
                  when a pawn is 2 rows away for the opponent pawn row. and a a
                  pawn next to your pawn does a
                  <a href="#doublePawnMove">two square move</a> so now it is
                  adjacent to your pawn; you HAVE to capture it. the capture
                  moves your pawn one diagonal forward and his pawn is captured
                  even tho you didn't touch the square the opponents pawn was
                  at. This rule is enforced and has to be played when possible
                  without exception. and if not played: the oppurtunity is lost
                  forever and cannot be played again!

                <p>Every piece has a unique way of moving.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>King</strong>: can move to any adjacent square
                    around it. it cannot legally move to a square where it can
                    be captures because that would end the game
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Rook</strong>: can go in a straight line in any 4
                    directions. cannot go past any pieces both his or opponents.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bishop</strong>: similar to a rook but can only go
                    in 4 diagonals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Queen</strong>: has the capability of both the rook
                    and the bishop.
                  </li>
                  <li id="knight">
                    <strong>Knight</strong>: (most complex one by far) can go to
                    any square thats 2 square forward and one square left and
                    right from there. if imagined it would move in a L shaped
                    path. can jump over pieces
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>pawn</strong>: can only move forward except in its
                    first move where it has the option to move two squares
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="illegalMoves">Illegal Moves</h4>
                <p>
                  illegal move is a move that would result in the instant
                  capture of the king. you can also not move to a square where
                  your piece is located at. or a square that blocked by another
                  piece (except if knight is moving) Note: you can also not jump
                  across boards in a tournament where boards are put next to
                  each other.
                </p>
                <h4>Check Moves</h4>
                <p>
                  if a move results in opponents king being under threat that is
                  called a check. when there is a check, only moves that can be
                  played has to either move away from the check, block the check
                  or capture the piece that is checking. any other move is
                  illegal.
                </p>
                <h4 id="doublePawnMove">Double Pawn Move</h4>
                <p>
                  when a pawn hasn't moved yet player has the option to move the
                  pawn two squares forward instead of the usual one square. this
                  move is only available at the pawns first more for each pawn.
                </p>
                <h4>Castling</h4>
                <p>
                  Castling is a unique form of move where the king and Rook from
                  any side can slide across each other. it is a weird move. if
                  there is no piece obstructing the way between the rook and the
                  king and there is no threat on the king or the space between
                  the rook and king; they can just change location where king
                  gets to the side rook was at and vice versa but they are still
                  touching each other just in opposite sides. yikes its hard to
                  explain. you need a board to see it on. but idc.

                  <h3>Capture</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>
                  a capture is when you put your piece on the same square as
                  your opponents piece and their piece is captured. has to be
                  removed from the board.
                </p>
                <h4>Pawn Capture</h4>
                <p>
                  unlike every piece where they capture where they can move to.
                  the pawn cannot capture where it can move. it can only capture
                  the two diagonal squares in front of him; left diagonal and
                  right diagonal.

                  <h3>Game Ending</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>
                  the game can end in three ways; win lose or draw. each one has
                  different ways of happening. the game can end in a victory in
                  two different ways; checkmate and resignation.
                </p>
                <h4>Checkmate</h4>
                <p>
                  a checkmate is when your/opponents king is checked and has no
                  way of escaping, blocking or capturing the checking piece. in
                  this case the game ends in a checkmate and its over. this is
                  by far the most common ending.
                </p>
                <h4>Resignation</h4>
                <p>
                  in any moment in the game you or your opponent can resign. and
                  leave the game. in this case the game is lost obviously
                </p>
                <h4>Run out of time</h4>
                <p>
                  if the game is played with a clock where both side has a
                  limited amount of time for their moves. and any side fails to
                  finish the game before their clock runs out it is a loss for
                  them.
                </p>
                <h4>Stalemate</h4>
                <p>
                  This is a form of draw, where if you have no legal moves left
                  but also is not under check the game ends in a stalemate and
                  it is a draw. most often happens when there is only king for
                  the stalemated.
                </p>
                <h4>Draw by Insufficient Material</h4>
                <p>
                  if both side doesn't have enough pieces to perform a checkmate
                  the game ends in a draw. this consists of the following
                  situations;
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>king vs king</li>
                  <li>king vs king+bishop</li>
                  <li>king vs king+knight</li>
                  <li>king+bishop vs king+bishop (if same colored bishops)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Draw by Repetition</h4>
                <p>
                  if last three moves of both sides are the same the game ends
                  in a draw like it or not. can be sometimes annoying because
                  opponent might be losing but you have no good move so they
                  just repeat themselves to get a unfair draw. but it has to be
                  claimed by either side to be draw other wise game continues.
                </p>
                <h4>Draw by Agreement</h4>
                <p>if both sides agree to a draw. it is a draw... surely.</p>
