        <p>
          you are very impressed by <strong>WWW</strong> but you are not quite
          sure what even is it. to put it shortly we can think of it as if you
          have telepath which anyone you want, and you could telepathically show
          anyone any information you want whenever they want to access it. and
          you don't have to do anything.
        </p>
        <h3>You are bullshitting me</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>no i am not..</strong> you are literally accessing it right
          now ru retarded or sum?

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>
          The www is a complex system that needs constant maintaining but also
          is very non-centralized and free-for-everyone type of system.
        </p>
        <p>
          it requares a lot of different technologies such as computer,
          electricity, the mouse, cd player, <i>blackberry phones</i>. but all
          you need to know about how it works is; it just does. like why would
          you <b>even care?</b> Just use it!
        </p>
        <p>but if you really want to learn it i guess;</p>
        <h3>for the normals</h3>
        <p>
          The World Wide Web (WWW) works as a vast system of interconnected
          documents and resources, accessed via the internet using web browsers.
          When a user enters a web address (URL) into a browser, the browser
          sends a request to a remote server using the Hypertext Transfer
          Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). That server, which hosts the website's
          files, responds by sending back the requested web page, usually coded
          in HTML. The browser then interprets the HTML, along with any
          associated files like CSS for styling and JavaScript for inter
          <i> Error in message stream (chatGPT died here)</i>
        </p>
        <h3>for the nerds</h3>
        <p>
          so basically the www connects different machines around the world
          via...
          <i>(drumroll please)</i> <b>Cables</b>. yep, there is just bunch of
          cables everywhere

        <p>
          world wide web has been the center of goverment activities in the last
          centuary. but what do they even need it for?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>monitoring the population</li>
          <li>integrating different goverment bodies</li>
          <li>collecting data and predicting uprises</li>
          <li>finding jews living inside the borders. (out of curiosity)</li>

          <dd>
            on the long trips www can be a form of safety against pirates; you
            can text them thru facebook messager so that they know you got
            weapons before they approach you.
          </dd>
          <dt>managment</dt>
          <dd>
            keeping track of all the containers can be done with WWW. This way
            all ports around the world can integrate their data.
          </dd>
          <dt>crew wellbeing</dt>
          <dd>
            with WWW the crew of the ships can access and reach people in the
