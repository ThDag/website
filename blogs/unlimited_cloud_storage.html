    <p> This is how to store files securely on free cloud storage providers and get the most of their provides services.
      using encrypted and file chunking when necessary. </p>

    <h2>Cloud Storage</h2>

    <p>there are many free cloud storage providers and the key is to get the most of all of them</p>
    <ul>
      <li> google cloud; 15gb per gmail account.
      </li>
      <li> box.com; 10gb per account
      </li>
      <li> microsoft onedrive; 5gb per account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>you can create as many accounts as you would like. for every gmail you create you get 30gb of storage. there are
      many other services but these are the ones i use
    </p>
    <h2>Centralized Access</h2>
    <p>in order to have all the services in a centralized place. i recommend <b>Transmit 5</b> that is a mac app. you
      can log into all the accounts and have access to all the files in one place.</p>

    <h2>Archiving</h2>
    <p>if your intended file if too big or if it is a directory wit a lot of files and folders. it is good to archive
      it. i will use `tar` command.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="miniHeader">To archive : </span>
      <span class="code">tar zcvf &lt;archived-file&gt;.tar.gz &lt;files-to-archive&gt;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="miniHeader">To extract : </span>
      <span class="code">tar xvf &lt;file-to-extract&gt; </span>
    </p>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>
    <p>before uploading files to the these insecure services. you have to encrypt them. my go to way of encryption them
      is <span class="code">age</span> command. it is a cli command and not a gui app which some people may be afraid of
      but it is what it is. </p>
    <p>there are two ways of encryption with <span class="code">age</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>with a private and public key</li>
      <li>with a passphrase</li>
    </ul>
