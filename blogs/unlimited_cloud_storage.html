  <h1>Unlimited Free Encrypted cloud storage trick</h1>

  <hr>

  <section class="blogMain">

    <p> This is how to store files securely on free cloud storage providers and get the most of their provides services.
      using encrypted and file chunking when necessary. </p>

    <h2>Cloud Storage</h2>

    <p>there are many free cloud storage providers and the key is to get the most of all of them</p>
    <ul>
      <li> google cloud; 15gb per gmail account.
      </li>
      <li> box.com; 10gb per account
      </li>
      <li> microsoft onedrive; 5gb per account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>you can create as many accounts as you would like. for every gmail you create you get 30gb of storage. there are
      many other services but these are the ones i use
    </p>
    <h2>Centralized Access</h2>
    <p>in order to have all the services in a centralized place. i recommend <b>Transmit 5</b> that is a mac app. you
      can log into all the accounts and have access to all the files in one place.</p>

    <h2>Archiving</h2>
    <p>if your intended file if too big or if it is a directory wit a lot of files and folders. it is good to archive
      it. i will use `tar` command.</p>

    <div class="codeContainer">
      <span class="miniHeader">To archive : </span>
      <span class="code">tar zcvf &lt;archived-file&gt;.tar.gz &lt;files-to-archive&gt;</span>
      <div class="desc">
        <span class="sideLine"></span>
        <span class="descText">this will archive yeah. will use gzip</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="codeContainer">
      <span class="miniHeader">To extract : </span>
      <span class="code">tar xvf &lt;file-to-extract&gt; </span>
      <div class="desc"><span class="sideLine"></span><span class="descText"> </span></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>
    <p>before uploading files to the these insecure services. you have to encrypt them. my go to way of encryption them
      is <span class="codeInline">age</span> command. it is a cli command and not a gui app which some people may be
      afraid of
      but it is what it is. </p>
    <p>there are two ways of encryption with <span class="codeInline">age</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>with a private and public key</li>
      <li>with a passphrase</li>
    </ul>


    <div class="sideBySide">
      <section class="sideBySideItem">
        <h3>with keys</h3>

        <div class="codeContainer">
          <span class="code">age-keygen &gt; key.txt</span>
          <div class="desc"><span class="sideLine"></span><span class="descText">to generate a key and save the private
              key to a file.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>keep this file secure and also save the public key that will be printed on the terminal. you will use it to
          encrypt the file.</p>
        <div class="codeContainer">
          <span class="code">age -r &lt;public-key&gt; -o &lt;output-file-name&gt;.age &lt;file-to-encrypt&gt;</span>
          <div class="desc">
            <span class="sideLine"></span>
            <span class="descText">
              this encrypts the file-to-encrypt with
              the key we generated and saves it with age subfix.
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>the file we have created can be decrypted simply by;</p>
        <div class="codeContainer">
          <span class="code">age -d -i key.txt -o &lt;decrypted-file&gt; &lt;encrypted-file&gt;</span>
          <div class="desc">
            <span class="sideLine"></span>
            <span class="descText">
              this will use the private key file we created and will decrypt the encrypted-file and save it as
              decrypted-file.
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>simple as that</p>
      </section>
      <section class="sideBySideItem">
        <h3>with passphrase</h3>
        <p>
          this doesn't require a key to be generated and managed. simple use a passphrase you can remember.
        </p>
        <div class="codeContainer">
          <span class="code">age -p -o &lt;output-file-name&gt;.age &lt;file-to-encrypt&gt;</span>
          <div class="desc">
            <span class="sideLine"></span>
            <span class="descText">
              after running this command it will ask for a passphrase. enter it and once again to confirm and file is
              encrypted.
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          to decrypt the file it is as simple as
        </p>
        <div class="codeContainer">
          <span class="code">age -d -o &lt;decrypted-file&gt; &lt;encrypted-file&gt;</span>
          <div class="desc">
            <span class="sideLine"></span>
            <span class="descText">
              this will ask for the passphrase and then save the decrypted version as decrypted-file
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>

    <h2>File Splitting</h2>
    <p>
      sometimes you might need to split very large files if you want to store them in separate cloud providers. but
      another reason to split files could be the file upload limit many cloud providers implement.
    </p>
    <p>for separating i use the `split` command that works both on linux and macos. for windows you are on your own lol.
      (you can use WSL maybe)</p>
    <p><b>you should split after encrypting</b></p>
    <p>before splitting a file you might want to archive it. i don't why but it feels more right and safe, it's just a
      feeling there is no proof or reason you might want to archive it. <span class="codeInline">split</span> command is
      pretty simple.</p>
    <div class="codeContainer">
      <span class="code">split -n 5 &lt;file-to-split&gt; &lt;prefix&gt;</span>
      <div class="desc">
        <span class="sideLine"></span>
        <span class="descText">
          this will split the file-to-split into five chunks. prefix is name of the files.
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p><b>Or</b></p>
    <div class="codeContainer">
      <span class="code">split -a 500M &lt;file-to_split&gt; &lt;prefix&gt;</span>
      <div class="desc">
        <span class="sideLine"></span>
        <span class="descText">
          this will split the file-to-split into chunks with the size of 500 megabytes. (last chunk is rest of the size)
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>the suffix "M" is for megabytes. there are several options for it</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="codeInline">K</span> for kilobytes</li>
      <li><span class="codeInline">M</span> for megabytes</li>
      <li><span class="codeInline">G</span> for gigabytes</li>
      <li>if nothing it added it will be bytes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>after splitting it will create the files with the names starting with `prefix` then will add `aa` and so on
      (`aa`, `ab`, `ac` ...)
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>yeah thats all i got. then you can upload them and abuse the capitalist conglomerates that all the files you
      could ever upload won't even feel like a spec of dust in their ginormous databases.
